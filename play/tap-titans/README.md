## Requirement

* ADB
* Image Magic
* Bash

## Get started
 * Start game

 ```bash
 chmod +x play.sh
 # Connect through lan, so you don't have to use the usb
 ./play.sh use-tcp
 # Push the pre-generated event file
 adb push events /mnt/sdcard
 # Start playing
 ./play.sh
 ```

## How is works ?

### Why fast ?
* Because I don't use `adb shell input tap`, instead use a generated file that represent a tap event, then `cat tap > /dev/input/event1`.
* Use generated shell run in android.

### How to detect the screen event ?
Use screen capture, then use the image magic to check the color,kind of slowly, but works.
