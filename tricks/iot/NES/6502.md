A		....	Accumulator	 	OPC A	 	operand is AC
abs		....	absolute	 	OPC $HHLL	 	operand is address $HHLL
abs,X		....	absolute, X-indexed	 	OPC $HHLL,X	 	operand is address incremented by X with carry
abs,Y		....	absolute, Y-indexed	 	OPC $HHLL,Y	 	operand is address incremented by Y with carry
#		....	immediate	 	OPC #$BB	 	operand is byte (BB)
impl		....	implied	 	OPC	 	operand implied
ind		....	indirect	 	OPC ($HHLL)	 	operand is effective address; effective address is value of address
X,ind		....	X-indexed, indirect	 	OPC ($BB,X)	 	operand is effective zeropage address; effective address is byte (BB) incremented by X without carry
ind,Y		....	indirect, Y-indexed	 	OPC ($LL),Y	 	operand is effective address incremented by Y with carry; effective address is word at zeropage address
rel		....	relative	 	OPC $BB	 	branch target is PC + offset (BB), bit 7 signifies negative offset
zpg		....	zeropage	 	OPC $LL	 	operand is of address; address hibyte = zero ($00xx)
zpg,X		....	zeropage, X-indexed	 	OPC $LL,X	 	operand is address incremented by X; address hibyte = zero ($00xx); no page transition
zpg,Y		....	zeropage, Y-indexed	 	OPC $LL,Y	 	operand is address incremented by Y; address hibyte = zero ($00xx); no page transition
```

## 寻址模式

形式|名字|例子|说明
----|----|----|----
A     | 累加器 | OPC A | 操作数为 AC
abs   | 绝对值 | OPC $HHLL | 操作数是地址 $HHLL
abs,X
