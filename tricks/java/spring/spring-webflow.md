# Spring Web Flow

Spring Web Flow builds on Spring MVC and allows implementing the "flows" of a web application. A flow encapsulates a sequence of steps that guide a user through the execution of some business task. It spans multiple HTTP requests, has state, deals with transactional data, is reusable, and may be dynamic and long-running in nature..

* 主要解决的问题
  * Visualizing the flow is very difficult.
  * The application has a lot of code accessing the HTTP session.
  * Enforcing controlled navigation is important but not possible.
  * Proper browser back button support seems unattainable.
  * Browser and server get out of sync with "Back" button use.
  * Multiple browser tabs causes concurrency issues with HTTP session data.
