PAX_MPROTECT
Enabling this option will prevent programs from
 - changing the executable status of memory pages that were
   not originally created as executable,
 - making read-only executable pages writable again,
 - creating executable pages from anonymous memory,
 - making read-only-after-relocations (RELRO) data pages writable again.

You should say Y here to complete the protection provided by
the enforcement of non-executable pages.

NOTE: you can use the 'chpax' or 'paxctl' utilities to control
this feature on a per file basis.


PAX_SOFTMODE
Enabling this option will allow you to run PaX in soft mode, that
is, PaX features will not be enforced by default, only on executables
marked explicitly.  You must also enable PT_PAX_FLAGS or XATTR_PAX_FLAGS
support as they are the only way to mark executables for soft mode use.

Soft mode can be activated by using the "pax_softmode=1" kernel command
line option on boot.  Furthermore you can control various PaX features
at runtime via the entries in /proc/sys/kernel/pax.
